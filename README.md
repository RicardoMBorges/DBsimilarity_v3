# DBsimilarity_v3


This repository provides a modular Python environment for chemical and metabolomic data analysis, built around RDKit and Mordred.
It includes tools for:

Molecule handling: Import SMILES/SDF/CSV, generate molecular fingerprints, calculate descriptors, and compute molecular formulas.

Similarity analysis: Tanimoto/cosine similarity, clustering, and chemotaxonomic indexing.

Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE, and interactive scatter plots with Plotly.

Visualization: Publication-ready interactive figures (2D and 3D projections, heatmaps, radar charts).

Custom workflows: Designed for metabolomics, natural products, and chemical space exploration, with easy integration of metadata.

The codebase is optimized for Jupyter Notebooks but can also be run as standalone scripts.
It aims to serve researchers working with natural products, secondary metabolites, or large chemical libraries, offering a reproducible and flexible pipeline for data-driven discovery.
